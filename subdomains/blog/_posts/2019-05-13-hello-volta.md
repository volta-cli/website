We’ve got a new version available… and a new name!

Volta 0.5.0 is out, with lots of new features and improvements, including:

- Improved stability
- Simpler and more helpful error messages
- Safe, fast management of npm-distributed binaries!
- Idiomatic version syntax (e.g. `typescript@3.4`)

About the name: Notion started as a Node version manager (hence the “No—” alliteration). Since then, two things happened: first, a number of people brought to our attention the Notion productivity tool, and we decided the polite thing to do would be to rename. Second, since the project has grown in scope to let you [manage arbitrary JavaScript tools](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/understanding#installing-package-binaries), we figured it was a good opportunity to rethink the name anyway!

For these reasons and after internal discussion, we decided on a new name. Notion is now Volta: The JavaScript Launcher ⚡! Our new website is up at [https://volta.sh/](https://volta.sh/).

Download Volta 0.5.0 and let us know what you think!

Last but not least, we owe our progress to a bunch of amazing collaborators and contributors. Special thanks to Ben Blank, Steve Calvert, Rob Jackson, Chris Krycho, Stef Penner, NullVoxPopuli, and Michael Stewart for their great feedback and contributions.
