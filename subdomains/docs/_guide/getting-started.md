# Getting Started

## Unix Installation

On most Unix systems including macOS, you can install Volta with a single command:

```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

For [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), and [fish](http://fishshell.com/), this installer will automatically update your console startup script. If you wish to prevent modifications to your console startup script, see [Skipping Volta Setup](/advanced/installers#skipping-volta-setup). To manually configure your shell to use Volta, edit your console startup scripts to:
- Set the `VOLTA_HOME` variable to `$HOME/.volta`
- Add `$VOLTA_HOME/bin` to the beginning of your `PATH` variable

## Windows Installation

For Windows, [download and run the Windows installer](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/releases/download/v{{ site.data.latest-version }}/volta-{{ site.data.latest-version }}-windows-x86_64.msi) and follow the instructions.

Or use [`winget`](https://aka.ms/winget-cli):

```bash
winget install Volta.Volta
```

{% include note.html content="Volta's functionality depends on creating symlinks, so you must either:
<ul>
    <li>Enable <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers\" target=\"_blank\" noreferrer noopener>Developer Mode</a> (recommended)</li>
    <li>Run Volta with elevated privileges (not recommended)</li>
</ul>" %}

### Windows Subsystem for Linux
